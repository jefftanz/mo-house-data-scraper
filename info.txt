From your browser, open the page where the button sits. Right click on the page and select "Inspect".
Then, from the DOM code, right click on the button, and select "Copy > Copy JS path".
That selector can be easily used in puppeteer.

// JS Path
document.querySelector("#main > div:nth-child(5) > form > div > div:nth-child(7) > div:nth-child(2) > input")

// Selector
#main > div:nth-child(5) > form > div > div:nth-child(7) > div:nth-child(2) > input

// Full X path
/html/body/div[1]/div/div[1]/form/div/div[7]/div[2]/input

Create a process to write to a logfile to keep track of all the data
- Easy to figure out what failed, or why data was incorrectly scrapped from a page
